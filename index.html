            <p>Marbled Murrelets are reliant on old-growth forests, where females will lay a single egg on the mossy limb of a tree hundreds of feet off the ground. Adults take turns foraging for fish and krill in the closest body of salt water, up to 50 miles away. The nest site of this species - not discovered in North America until 1974 - was one of the last great ornithological mysteries.</p>

            <p>Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge lies in northern Utah, where the Bear River flows into the northeast arm of the Great Salt Lake.  The Refuge protects the marshes found at the mouth of the Bear River; these marshes are the largest freshwater component of the Great Salt Lake ecosystem.  Since these marshes are in turn surrounded by arid desert lands, it is little wonder that they have always been an oasis for waterbirds and wildlife</p>
